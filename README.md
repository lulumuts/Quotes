 #### By Lulu Mutuli

 ## Quotes lets you input your name, your favorite quotes and their authors. It lets you upvote or downvote any previous uploads, and should tell you when it was last voted on.

 ## Setup/Installation Requirements
 To run this application, you need angular 5, or a Typescript editor of a sort. You need to link it to your github account for deployment and a gh-pages branch will be necessary at the end of the project. You will need to serve this app, so you will need npm and node.js.

 # Quotes

 This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

 ## Development server

 Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

 ## Code scaffolding

 Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

 ## Build

 Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

 ## Running unit tests

 Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

 ## Running end-to-end tests

 Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

 ## Further help

 To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

 ## The known bugs that exist are that the pipes are not working, the form output does not display just yet.

  ## Angular 5 was used to create this project, as well as githubs gh-pages. I imported moments.js as well.
